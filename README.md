# Exploring Regression Models: A Comparative Study on Salary Prediction

## Overview
This notebook presents a comparative analysis of regression models applied to the Salary Dataset. The objective is to evaluate and understand the performance of various regression algorithms in predicting salary based on years of experience.

## Models Used
In this notebook, I explore and compare the following models:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Neural Network Regression**

## Performance Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average difference between predicted values and actual values.

## Key Findings
- **Neural Network Model Superiority**: The Neural Network model outperformed the Linear Regression model across both key metrics. It achieved a significantly lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 849.3639 and a lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 654.8385.
- **Note:** The superior performance of the Neural Network is partly due to extensive parameter tuning and optimization, whereas the Linear Regression model was not as extensively fine-tuned.


## Conclusion
This notebook provides insights into how Linear Regression and Neural Network models perform in predicting salary from years of experience. In my analysis, the Neural Network model performed the best according to two performance metrics.
